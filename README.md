# CSS Massive Multiplayer Online

An educational CSS multiplayer playground. Works well for teaching a group about CSS properties and keeping their attention on the task.

`npm start` and get everyone on the same page ;)

## Intro

> When you type in your name (make it short) you get a small rectangle on the screen. Now unleash your creativity and make it look interesting!
> The only limitation is that you can't make your rectangle too big

## Abuse protection

If someone is misbehaving, click them 3 times. Their rectangle fades out on your screen and a vote is scored to kick them. Majority vote kicks them out of the game.
